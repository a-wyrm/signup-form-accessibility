#Simulate Tab Presses: Use Keys.TAB to simulate keyboard navigation.
#Get Active Element: Use driver.switchTo().activeElement() to get the currently focused element.
#Track Focus Order: Store the sequence of focused elements to verify logical order.
#Verify Visual Focus Indicator: This is the hardest part. You will have to get the css properties of the active element, and verify that a focus indicator is present. This can be done by validating the existance of outline, border, or background color changes when the element is focused.
#Detect Keyboard Traps: Implement a loop that repeatedly presses Keys.TAB. If the same element is focused multiple times in a row, it might indicate a keyboard trap.
